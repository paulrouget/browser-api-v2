// EXPERIMENTAL AND TEMPORARY

// Below interfaces are not optimized for performance but for ease of
// implementation.
// 
// The goal it to be able to experiment with non-linear history. Entries are
// stored in an array. When a user goes back in the history and then navigates,
// the previous forward history is dropped. We want to be able to experiment
// with saving that previous forward history, moving from an array structure to
// a tree structure. This goes against the web specifications, and might
// involve intrusive changes in Servo.
//
// The following interfaces are a temporary solution that doesn't require much
// work on Servo's side, and at the same time make it possible to build a tree
// structure at the API consumer level. There are some drawbacks.  Pipeline's
// are dropped, only the LoadData is saved, and the consumer has to maintain an
// alternate history structure.
