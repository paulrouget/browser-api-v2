API build blindly, from an embedder point of view.

Events:
- embedder gets a OS event
- embedder finds the related compositor
- embedder finds to relevant Browser
  - for key events, find the viewport with a focused browser
  - for point events, find the viewport under the point
- embedder send event to browser
- browser send back the event after it's been consumed
