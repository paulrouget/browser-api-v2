// Holds offline data: appcache, cookies, fileSystem, indexdb, localStorage, serviceworkers. Has

// A storage session stores offline data (cookies, localStorage, â€¦). To build a session recovery,
// storage session needs to be serialized and written to disk, along with a list of list of list of
// LoadData (for tab restore). List of list of list because a browser is usually made of a list of
// windows made of a list of tabs made of a list of history entries. It's up to the embedder to
// regularly saved the session. The process of writing the storage session and the loaddata will
// require disk access, which is supposed to be handled by the embedder.

// To build a private browsing mode, all that is necessary is to create a new session with no id,
// and never write it to disk. // FIXME: Is that enough?
